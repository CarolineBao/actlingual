          <div>When an individual does not speak enough English to fully understand the situation in different health and social settings, they aren’t able to fully communicate or make well-informed decisions. MIT ActLingual members bridge this gap by connecting multilingual/multicultural students with opportunities in the MIT/Boston/Cambridge area to use their language skills to aid the lives of people in the communities around MIT.

          <div>The Actlingual team is currently working on a curriculum for a medical interpreting class to prepare MIT students to address the critical need for medical interpreters in the MIT/Cambridge/Boston area. We are also partnered with the Cambridge Health Alliance, Everett Haitian Community Center, and MIT Asian American Initiative to provide aid to multiple service initiatives in the Boston/Cambridge area.
