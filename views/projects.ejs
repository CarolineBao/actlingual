This semester, Medlingual is providing instruction in medical interpreting by supporting students who wish to self-study the required material. Fill out the form below to receive study materials on medical interpretation in the core areas of Anatomy/Physiology, Interpreter Ethics/Code of Conduct, and Medical Terminology/Role Play. Besides providing these materials, we will also host several on-campus sessions during which students will practice roleplaying as interpreters.
